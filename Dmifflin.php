		<h2 class="h3H"> Get to know the Dunder Mifflin</h2>
		<p> For years, Dunder Mifflin's corporate website merely said "Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!" This placeholder website existed as Dunder Mifflin's online presence until the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website launched on October 19th 2007. </p> 
		<p>In the episode Dunder Mifflin Infinity, Ryan Howard introduces a new initiative to bring Dunder Mifflin into the internet area. According to Ryan, the new Dunder Mifflin Infinity website "represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The centerpiece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that "Will allow us (Dunder Mifflin) to compete directly with big box chains."</p>

		<h3> Get to know the staff of Dunder Mifflin </h3>
		<p > The website launches in the episode Launch Party with a bash in New York City, attended virtually by the branch offices via webcam.</p>

		<p>In Night Out, it appears that the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website is in trouble. Ryan instructs the Scranton branch to enter its conventional sales as if they were online sales as "a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site". Sales made online are not credited as commissions to the salesperson responsible for the account but Ryan claims problems such as this will be addressed in "Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2.0". </p>

		<p>The Dunder Mifflin Infinity website also includes a social networking feature, which Ryan claims is to create "A one stop shop consumer experience. You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store." This social networking section is, unfortunately infiltrated by sexual predators. During the Christmas party, Jim discussed with David Wallace his doubts about the website and its social networking (which Dwight also felt was unneeded). Ryan took extreme offense at this and started seeking ways to discredit Jim in order to fire him.</p>

		<p>In the episode Goodbye, Toby, the deceptions surrounding Dunder Mifflin Infinity are exposed, and Ryan Howard is arrested for misleading shareholders by double-booking conventional sales as both conventional sales and online sales, which is also known as fraud. </p>
